Does anyone know how to convert the Visited System addresses in the save file correctly? The problem I am having is that I am getting it mostly right, but the planet code is wrong.

I was trying to remember which planet I was on when I got a hauler that I liked so that I could buy it again for another game save that I was playing. 
I figured out that the game save had all the visited systems stored in decimal integer format like so:

				"VisitedSystems": [
					334347860181407
				],

From the data above, I converted it to hex: 0x000130166D70019F
I noticed that the format of the number had Y and Z swapped from the Portal Address described  here: https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Coordinates 
There are multiple different formats for coordinates:
	Visited System Code format: Planet?, Solar System Index,	Z,	Y,	X               # Planet can't be right here, there must be another fudge factor I don't know about.
	Portal String Format: Planet ,Solar System Index,	Y,	Z,	X
	Signal Booster String Format: Scanner ID,	X,	Y,	Z,	Solar System Index

I translated 0x000130166D70019F to: 0x3016006D719F and dropped the leading 1 ( not sure what it is for).

The above portal address converts to: http://nmsportals.github.io/#3016006D719F
However, the problem I have is that the address is the correct system, but not the right planet. When I take a screenshot with the address shown from the same planet, it isn't the 
address. When I teleport to http://nmsportals.github.io/#3016006D719F, it is the wrong planet. The correct planet address is 0x5016006D719F. 
http://nmsportals.github.io/#5016006D719F It isn't consistent either, sometimes the planet number is right, sometimes it is off by 1, and then sometimes like 
in the above example, it is off by 2.
